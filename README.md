Lilnk to the completed project:

In progress

A very simple project that incorporates CSS flexbox techniques to create a landing page.

While this is a basic review for me, and below my skill level; I chose to complete it following the guidelines of The Odin Project and commitment to complete this course, step by step, in its full integrity.

Project takeaways:
* Importance of using best CSS practices for creating a landing page.
* The simplicity of CSS flex-box; adding a new tool to complement CSS grid.
